🧵 Producer-Consumer Problem in C

    This project demonstrates a basic simulation of the Producer-Consumer Problem using global variables and simple mutual exclusion logic in C.
📝 Description

    Simulates a producer adding items to a buffer and a consumer removing them.

    Controls access to the buffer using a simulated mutex.

    Uses counters for full, empty, and a single item x to track state.

    Fixed buffer size of 5.

⚙️ Requirements

    C compiler (e.g., GCC)

    Command-line interface

🚀 How to Run

    Compile the file with a C compiler.

    Run the executable.

    Choose between Producer, Consumer, or Exit through the menu-driven interface.

    Observe buffer operations and messages.

⚠️ Disclaimer

    This code is a simplified educational example of the Producer-Consumer problem. It does not implement true concurrency or synchronization mechanisms like semaphores or threads.
